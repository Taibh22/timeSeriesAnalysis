# ECAD Temperature Data for Germany - Berlin: Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis of the ECAD temperature data for Germany - Berlin, including how to clean the data, build a baseline model modeling trend and seasonality, plot and inspect the different components of the time series, model time dependence of the remainder using an AR model or ARIMA model, compare the statistics output of different AR models, and test the remainder for stationarity. The data analysis will be done using Jupyter Notebook with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, and Statsmodels libraries.

## Dataset
The ECAD temperature data for Germany - Berlin contains daily temperature measurements from January 1st, 1949 to December 31st, 2020. The dataset has two columns: "Date" and "Temp", where "Date" represents the date of the temperature measurement and "Temp" represents the temperature in degrees Celsius.

## Cleaning the Data
Before analyzing the data, we will first need to clean it. This includes checking for and handling missing values, converting the date column to a datetime object, and setting the date column as the index of the dataframe.

## Building a Baseline Model
We will start by building a baseline model that models the trend and seasonality of the time series. This model will help us understand the underlying patterns in the data and serve as a point of comparison for more complex models.

## Plotting and Inspecting the Different Components of the Time Series
We will plot and inspect the different components of the time series, including the trend, seasonality, and remainder. This will help us understand how each component contributes to the overall pattern in the data.

## Modeling Time Dependence of the Remainder Using an AR Model or ARIMA Model
We will model the time dependence of the remainder using an AR model or ARIMA model. This will help us capture any remaining patterns in the data that are not accounted for by the trend and seasonality components.

## Comparing the Statistics Output of Different AR Models
We will compare the statistics output of different AR models to determine which model provides the best fit to the data. This will help us select the best model to use for forecasting.

## Testing the Remainder for Stationarity
We will test the remainder for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. This will help us determine if the remainder is stationary, which is a necessary condition for using an AR or ARIMA model.

## Conclusion
In this time series analysis, we have explored the ECAD temperature data for Germany - Berlin, cleaned the data, built a baseline model, plotted and inspected the different components of the time series, modeled time dependence of the remainder using an AR model or ARIMA model, compared the statistics output of different AR models, and tested the remainder for stationarity. This analysis provides a foundation for future forecasting and analysis of temperature data in Berlin.
